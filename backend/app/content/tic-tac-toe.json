It is one of the most versatile data types in Python.\n```python\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n```\n\nA **List of Lists** (or 2D List) is simply a list where each element is *another* list. This is perfect for representing grids, matrices, or tables.\n\n#### Example: A 2x2 Grid\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [1, 2],  # Row 0\n    [3, 4]   # Row 1\n]\n```\n\nTo access the number `3`, you would use `grid[1][0]` (Row 1, Column 0).\n\n### Documentation & Resources\n- **Official Documentation**: [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)\n- **Article**: [Python Lists and List Manipulation](https://realpython.com/python-lists-tuples/)\n- **Video**: [Python Lists - Everything you need to know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohCDWZgNIU0)",

            "notes": "### The `for` Loop\n\nA `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).

This means the first item is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.\n\n```python\nmy_list = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\nprint(my_list[0]) # Output: \"a\"\n```\n\n### Modifying Lists\nLists are **mutable**, meaning you can change their content after creation. You can change the value of a specific item by assigning to its index.\n\n```python\nmy_list[1] = \"z\"\nprint(my_list) # Output: [\"a\", \"z\", \"c\"]\n```\n\nFor a 2D list, you need two indices: `list[row_index][column_index]`.
